You may have heard of website builders such as Wix, GoDaddy, or SquareSpace. Why choose us over them? Well, first we should consider the cost.

- Wix: **$204.00/yr**
- GoDaddy: **$131.88/yr** (for the first year, then **$155.88/yr**)
- SquareSpace: **$172.00/yr**

How much do we cost? We charge only **$60.00/yr**, including a custom domain. Note that this doesn't include the website itself (only hosting). We will build a static website for **$100.00**, including custom functionality. Note that all of these plans listed are at the cheapest tier you can get.

That's all for the cost section, but what about storage? Here is a comparison of storage:

- Wix: **2 GB**
- GoDaddy: **30GB**
- SquareSpace: **Unlimited**

How much storage do we provide? We provide **unlimited** storage.

Finally, we can provide something that web builders simply cannot and will not: custom requests. When you hire us to build you a static website, we will recieve and complete requests that you want for your website, such as calculators, quizzes, interactive parts, etc.
