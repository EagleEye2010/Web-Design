# We are now hiring!

With high growth, we are seeking independent contractors to help keep up with continued demand for our websites. We will gladly pay **$85.00** per static website built. Developers must know how to make a website with HTML, CSS, and JS. Knowledge of Hugo is not required but will make for a better candidate.
