      <description>You may have heard of website builders such as Wix, GoDaddy, or SquareSpace. Why choose us over them? Well, first we should consider the cost.&#xA;Wix: $204.00/yr GoDaddy: $131.88/yr (for the first year, then $155.88/yr) SquareSpace: $172.00/yr How much do we cost? We charge only $60.00/yr, including a custom domain. Note that this doesn&amp;rsquo;t include the website itself (only hosting). We will build a static website for $100.00, including custom functionality.</description>

We will gladly pay $85.00 per static website built. Developers must know how to make a website with HTML, CSS, and JS.
